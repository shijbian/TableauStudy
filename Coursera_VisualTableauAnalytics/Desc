This is the peer assignment for Week 1 Visual Analytics with Tableau from Coursera.

Since I am using Tableau professional, it required extra steps in order to export the Tableau work book to Tableau public.

In other words, the workbook created by professional version can not be opened in Tableau public.

Therefore, I took the screen capture of the workbook, it shows both the overall view and the dropdown function.
